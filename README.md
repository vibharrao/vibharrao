## Featured Contributions
Contributed to the XpressO pipeline, a modular, explainable deep learning framework for linking histopathology with transcriptomic profiles across multiple cancers, including breast cancer, melanoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. The framework employs weakly supervised attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) on whole-slide images (WSIs) and bulk RNA-seq data from TCGA, enabling gene- and mutation-level prediction with spatial interpretability. By integrating segmentation, patch-level feature extraction using Vision Transformer embeddings, and heatmap visualization of high-attention regions, XpressO provides biologically meaningful insights into spatial gene expression heterogeneity within tumors and their microenvironments.
